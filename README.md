# Deduplication#

Applying information and web search engines techniques on NASA's polar dataset

1. Implemented near and exact de-duplication algorithms using text similarity, min hashing and Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithms.

2. Developed text and link relevancy based ranking algorithms to create search engine for crawled data.  Above all techniques are developed on polar dataset by leveraging Apache Nutch, Tika, Solr capabilities.
